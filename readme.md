## lexical based rte

### reqs:

- [x] rich text w/ bold, italic, underline.
- [ ] block select: paragraph, heading, sub-heading
- [ ] quotes
- [ ] links w/ editing text & url
- [ ] lists
- [ ] images
- [ ] history
- [ ] soft-breaks + softbreak button
- [ ] tooltips for everything
- [ ] justify every block node or none at all
- [ ] CFE: uneditable void nodes whose content are external state completely unrelated to the text editor itself & buttons to insert these.
- [ ] "controlled" behaviour (reset to value functionality)
- [ ] serializing & deserializing (html > lexical & vice versa)
- [ ] not going insane doing the CFE & controlled stuff. Drop controlled behaviour (but keep reset) if it causes too many issues
