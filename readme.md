### reqs:

- [x] rich text w/ bold, italic, underline.
- [x] block select: paragraph, heading, sub-heading
- [x] quotes
- [x] links w/ editing text & url
- [x] lists
- [x] images
- [x] history
- [x] soft-breaks + softbreak button
- [ ] !!! justify every block node or none at all
- [ ] !!! CFE: uneditable void nodes whose content are external state completely unrelated to the text editor itself & buttons to insert these.
- [ ] !!! "controlled" behaviour (reset to value functionality)
